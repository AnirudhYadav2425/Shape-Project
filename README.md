📐 Java Shapes Project
This is a Java-based object-oriented program that models various 2D and 3D geometric shapes, demonstrating principles of inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and interface implementation. The project includes a user-interactive menu for performing shape-related operations like area, perimeter, and volume calculations.

🚀 Features
🔷 Models both 2D shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle) and 3D shapes (Sphere, Cone, Cylinder)

🧮 Calculates:

Area and perimeter for 2D shapes

Surface area and volume for 3D shapes

📚 Demonstrates object-oriented concepts:

Inheritance (TwoDShape and ThreeDShape as base classes)

Abstraction and Interfaces

Polymorphism

📥 Interactive user input via User.java / Game.java

📁 Files Included
File Name	Description
Shape.java	Base interface or abstract class for all shapes
TwoDShape.java	Abstract class for 2D shapes
ThreeDShape.java	Abstract class for 3D shapes
Circle.java	Represents a 2D Circle shape
Rectangle.java	Represents a 2D Rectangle shape
Triangle.java	Represents a 2D Triangle shape
Sphere.java	Represents a 3D Sphere shape
Cone.java	Represents a 3D Cone shape
Cylinder.java	Represents a 3D Cylinder shape
Game.java	Logic and menu-based interaction class
User.java	Entry point for running the application
